### Reflection (STAR technique):
I was under stress on which career field to follow based on what I love doing as I did not make a final decision to go for a career or pursue my education further. The goal of the course was to help me prepare for my future in the working industry. The task that I had to do was that I needed to know myself based on my gifts and talents. I decided to construct my CV based on the skills and talents I have, making it easier to find work I am skilled in. In this course, I was also able to set SMART (Specific, Measureable, Attainable, Relevant, Time-Bound) goals for my future. The outcome of learning this course was that it encouraged me to set realistic and acheivable goals according to the SMART format and work towards that goal.

### Reflection (STAR technique): 
Reflecting on the CV submission, I was expected to deliver up CV up to standards when applying for the job.

The action I took was that I reflected on myself based on my skills and the other courses I did before this submission. I would also research the best CV designs to make it a bit competitive. The outcome was that when my CV was submitted, the feedback I got was that it was nice, but it needed a bit of fixing in terms of my education timeline.
